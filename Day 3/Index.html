            <p class="highlight">Andrew Ryan was born in 1912 in the Soviet Union. He was a brilliant
                 businessman and entrepreneur, and he quickly made a name 
                 for himself in the world of finance. In the 1940s, 
                 Ryan became disillusioned with the political and economic systems 
                 of the time, and he decided to create his own society.</p>
